# fdw

File Dependencies Walker for Windows's PE and DLL files.

Usage:
```bash
fdw <file> --search-paths=<path>
```

Everything is written from scratch, for both educational purposes (the goal of this project was to get familiar with Rust and learn more about PE/DLL) and control over dependencies (I don't like to rely on a lot of dependencies, we never know).
